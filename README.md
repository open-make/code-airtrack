# README

This repository contains the two versions of the code for the Airtrack.
One code is for the Airtrack with Pixycam1 and one with the Pixycam2.

Within the .ino of the Airtrack code you can set the "test_run" variable to true to have some prints of finished setup tasks.

Additionally, there is a code to push or pull the linear actuator.



You can find the previous documentation under [neuro-airtrack.com/](http://www.neuro-airtrack.com/).
